# Prompt

now...one thing i'm curious about is how much we're leveraging what's been done already for org mode parsers - @https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tools/index.html these a BUNCH listed here. and here's some background that might help @https://github.com/org-rs/org-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#prior-art and @https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser  org mode for emacs source: @https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/org-mode.git/tree/lisp/org-element.el the official org mode element doc: @https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html  and official org mode syntax doc: @https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html  - let's take a beat, look through these, and then revise the plan first, carefully, then we can begin implementation again. take your time. no rush.

# Org Mode Parser Research and Revised Implementation Plan

After reviewing the resources you've shared, I can see there's a wealth of existing work on Org Mode parsers that we can learn from. Let's analyze what's available and then revise our implementation plan.

## Analysis of Existing Org Mode Parsers

### Common Approaches

Looking at the [list of Org Mode parsers](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tools/index.html), I notice several implementation patterns:

1. **Grammar-based parsers** (like org-parser using BNF)
2. **Recursive descent parsers** (common in many implementations)
3. **State machine parsers** (particularly for handling inline formatting)

### Notable Implementations

- [**org-parser**](https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser) - Uses a formal BNF grammar, which is similar to our PEG.js approach
- [**org-rs**](https://github.com/org-rs/org-rs) - Rust implementation with a focus on performance
- [**orgize**](https://github.com/PoiScript/orgize) - Another Rust implementation with good documentation
- [**go-org**](https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org) - Go implementation that's well-structured

### Official Org Mode Documentation

The [Org Mode syntax documentation](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html) provides a comprehensive reference for the syntax elements we need to support. The [Org Element API](https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html) gives insight into how Emacs Org Mode structures its AST.

## Key Insights from Research

1. **Incremental Parsing**: Many implementations parse the document in multiple passes, first identifying structural elements (headings, lists) and then handling inline formatting.

2. **AST Structure**: The Org Element API shows a clear hierarchy of elements that we should mirror in our implementation.

3. **Handling Special Characters**: Square brackets and other special characters in PEG.js require careful escaping or alternative approaches.

4. **List Parsing Complexity**: Lists in Org Mode have nuanced rules for nesting and indentation that require careful handling.

## Revised Implementation Plan

Based on this research, I propose the following revised approach:

### 1. Structural Elements First

Let's focus on getting the structural elements right before adding inline formatting:

1. **Headings** (with TODO keywords)
2. **Lists** (unordered and ordered)
3. **Paragraphs**

### 2. List Implementation

For list parsing, we should:

1. Define clear rules for list markers (`-`, `+`, `*` for unordered; `1.`, `2.`, etc. for ordered)
2. Handle indentation properly for nested lists
3. Support list item content that spans multiple lines

### 3. Grammar Structure

```
document
  = newline* children:(heading / list / paragraph)* {
      return createDocument(children);
    }

list
  = items:list_item+ {
      // Determine if this is an ordered or unordered list
      const firstItem = items[0];
      const ordered = firstItem.ordered;
      return createList(items, ordered);
    }

list_item
  = indent:whitespace? marker:list_marker whitespace content:(!newline .)* newline children:indented_block* {
      const isOrdered = typeof marker === 'string' ? marker.indexOf('.') > 0 : false;
      const contentText = content.map(c => c[1]).join('');
      const contentNodes = [createText(contentText)];
      const childNodes = children.filter(Boolean) || [];
      return createListItem(contentNodes, childNodes, isOrdered);
    }

list_marker
  = marker:("-" / "+" / "*") { return marker; }
  / number:[0-9]+ "." { return number.join('') + "."; }

indented_block
  = indent:whitespace list_content:list_item { return list_content; }
  / indent:whitespace content:(!newline .)+ newline {
      const contentText = content.map(c => c[1]).join('');
      return createParagraph([createText(contentText)]);
    }
```

### 4. Handling PEG.js Limitations

To address the issues with PEG.js and special characters:

1. Use character codes or carefully escaped literals for problematic characters
2. Consider using simpler pattern matching for certain elements
3. Test incrementally with small examples before adding complexity

## Next Steps

1. Implement the revised list parsing rules
2. Test with simple list examples first
3. Gradually add support for nested lists
4. Ensure proper indentation handling

This approach should give us a more robust foundation based on established patterns from existing Org Mode parsers.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this revised plan for list support?
