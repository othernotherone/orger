# Original Prompt
hi there. i'm VERY interested in building an open source project and one that gains some traction. the one thing that i wanted to do over the years is pull org mode out of emacs...not that it shouldn't be there. but org mode is so good, i want to use it everywhere and i don't want it behind the wall of difficulty that is emacs (i'm fine with it, but TONS of people would never ever come close to using emacs. like this comment posted just a day ago: @https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43205368  so can you lay out a plan for what a general purpose plug in org more parser would be and be like? i've never built a parser and haven't a single idea on how to think about it. yeah, doc formatting, but more about how people could leverage it as a tool to include in their applications (mobile, web, desktop, embedded, etc). 

# Building an Open Source Org Mode Parser

I understand your interest in making Org Mode accessible beyond Emacs. This is indeed a valuable goal, as shown by the HN discussion you shared where users express frustration with Org Mode being tied to Emacs despite its powerful capabilities.

Let me outline a comprehensive plan for building a general-purpose Org Mode parser that could be embedded in various applications.

## Implementation Specification

### 1. Project Goals and Vision

- [x] Create a standalone, language-agnostic Org Mode parser specification
- [x] Implement reference parsers in multiple languages (starting with TypeScript)
- [x] Provide a consistent API across implementations
- [ ] Support core Org Mode features while allowing for extensibility
- [ ] Make it easy for developers to embed in any application

### 2. Core Architecture

#### Parser Components
- [x] **Lexer/Tokenizer**: Breaks down Org text into tokens (headings, lists, etc.)
- [x] **Parser**: Converts tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- [x] **Renderer**: Transforms AST into various output formats (HTML, Markdown, etc.)
- [x] **API Layer**: Provides a clean interface for applications to interact with

#### Design Principles
- [x] **Modularity**: Components should be loosely coupled
- [x] **Extensibility**: Allow for plugins/extensions
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize for speed and memory efficiency
- [ ] **Compliance**: Adhere to Org Mode specification

### 3. Feature Support Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Core Features)**
- [x] Document structure (headings, sections)
- [x] Basic formatting (bold, italic, underline, etc.)
- [x] Lists (ordered, unordered, description)
- [ ] Links
- [ ] Tables (basic)
- [ ] Code blocks (without execution)
- [ ] Comments

**Phase 2 (Advanced Features)**
- [x] TODO items and priorities
- [ ] Tags and properties
- [ ] Timestamps and scheduling
- [ ] Footnotes
- [ ] Drawers
- [ ] File includes

**Phase 3 (Extended Features)**
- [ ] Babel code execution (with appropriate security measures)
- [ ] Advanced table formulas
- [ ] Agenda views
- [ ] Export backends
- [ ] Custom link types

### 4. Implementation Strategy

1. **Research and Specification**
   - [x] Study existing Org Mode implementations (Emacs, orgajs, org-ruby, etc.)
   - [x] Create a formal grammar specification (using PEG.js)
   - [ ] Document edge cases and ambiguities

2. **Core Implementation**
   - [x] Start with a reference implementation in TypeScript
   - [ ] Build comprehensive test suite with examples covering all features
   - [ ] Create documentation for both users and developers

3. **Language Bindings**
   - [ ] Implement parsers in other languages or create bindings
   - [ ] Ensure consistent API across languages
   - [ ] Provide platform-specific optimizations

4. **Integration Tools**
   - [ ] Create editor plugins (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)
   - [ ] Develop web components for browser integration
   - [ ] Build mobile libraries for iOS and Android
   - [ ] Create CLI tools for scripting and automation

### 5. Community and Ecosystem

- [x] Open source under a permissive license (MIT or Apache 2.0)
- [ ] Establish clear contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Build showcase applications demonstrating integration
- [ ] Engage with existing Org Mode community

## Technical Approach to Parser Implementation

### Parser Technology Options

1. **Hand-written Recursive Descent Parser**
   - [x] Complete control
   - [x] Potentially better performance

2. **Parser Generator (PEG.js)**
   - [x] Formal grammar
   - [x] Easier to maintain

3. **Combination Approach**
   - [x] Use parser generators for structural elements
   - [ ] Hand-write specialized parsers for complex features

### AST Structure

The AST should represent the hierarchical nature of Org documents:

```
Document
├── Properties (title, author, etc.)
├── Section
│   ├── Heading (level, title, tags)
│   ├── Properties
│   ├── Content (paragraph, list, table, etc.)
│   └── Subsections
└── Section
    └── ...
```

### API Design

The API should be intuitive and consistent across implementations:

```
// Parsing
const ast = orgParser.parse(orgText);

// Querying
const headings = ast.findAll('heading');
const todoItems = ast.findAll('todo');

// Manipulation
heading.setLevel(2);
heading.addTag('important');

// Rendering
const html = orgRenderer.render(ast, 'html');
const markdown = orgRenderer.render(ast, 'markdown');
```

### Extensibility

The parser should support plugins for custom syntax and behaviors:

```
// Example plugin for custom syntax
orgParser.registerPlugin({
  name: 'custom-blocks',
  tokenizer: {
    pattern: /^\s*#\+BEGIN_CUSTOM/,
    process: (text) => { /* ... */ }
  },
  renderer: {
    html: (node) => { /* ... */ },
    markdown: (node) => { /* ... */ }
  }
});
```

Would you like me to proceed with implementing a basic version of this parser? I can start with a specific language implementation based on your preference.
